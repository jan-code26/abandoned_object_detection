      <h2>Welcome to our Website</h2>
      <p>This website deals with the detection of Abandoned Object.This paper is focused towards developing a computer vision-based approach that analyzes the blob areas to detect any abandoned objects and instantaneously send appropriate alerts without any human intervention. The approach has been tested with various benchmark video datasets and real-time video sequences as well. In this project, weâ€™re going to make an Abandoned object detection system using OpenCV and python. OpenCV is a real-time computer vision and image processing library for python. OpenCV is very popular because it is lightweight and contains more than 2500 image processing algorithms.</p>
