                        This website deals with the detection of Abandoned Object.
                        This paper is focused towards developing a computer vision-based 
                        approach that analyzes the blob areas to detect any abandoned objects
                         and instantaneously send appropriate alerts without any human intervention. 
                         The approach has been tested with various benchmark video datasets and 
                         real-time video sequences as well. In this project, weâ€™re going to make 
                         an Abandoned object detection system using OpenCV and python. OpenCV is 
                         a real-time computer vision and image processing library for python. 
                         OpenCV is very popular because it is lightweight and contains 
                         more than 2500 image processing algorithms. </p>
                      <p class="description-p text-muted pe-0 pe-lg-0">Overall, 
                        the Abandoned Object Detection project combines the power 
                        of computer vision, OpenCV, and real-time video analysis 
                        to provide an automated and proactive approach to identify 
                        and handle abandoned objects.</p>

                      Upon user video upload, the following steps are taken for abandoned object detection</p>

                       <li>Initialization: A static picture is captured from the uploaded video, which serves as a reference frame. This initial frame should not contain any suspicious or moving objects. It provides a baseline for comparison.</li>
                      <li>Frame Comparison: Each subsequent frame of the video is compared to the initial frame. The difference between the static picture and the real-time frames is computed to identify any changes or discrepancies.</li>
                      <li>Object Identification: The filtered differences are analyzed to identify and track objects. The position and state of each object are continuously monitored throughout the video.</li>
                      <li>Abandoned Object Detection: If an object is detected to be in motion, no further action is taken. However, if an object remains stationary in the same position for a certain duration, it is considered as an abandoned or suspicious object. This signifies a potential security concern that requires attention.</li>
